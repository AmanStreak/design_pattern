- Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems.

- Dart supports implementing popular patterns like:
    - **Singleton:** Ensures a class has only one instance.
    - **Factory:** Creates objects without exposing instantiation logic.
    - **Observer:** Notifies multiple objects about state changes.

## ðŸš€ Benefits of Design Patterns

- **Code Reusability:** Write less code by reusing proven solutions.
- **Easier Maintenance:** Simplifies updates and bug fixes.
- **Standardized Solutions:** Promotes best practices and consistency across projects.
